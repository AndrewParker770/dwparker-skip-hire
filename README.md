# Outline
This repository holds a website at the behest of D.W.Parker Skip hire. The breif was to create a new website that cost them a fraction of the cost of their previous one, which was created from Yell from a template. This previous website was also unresponsive, only updating deplay on refresh, which had been commented on my customers in the past.

This project is created in React from scratch, meaning it is composed of javascript, HTML, and CSS. The information and pictures on the page were supplied by the customer.  

## Noteworthy Components
